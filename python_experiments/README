MPLCONFIGDIR=/data/scratch/pkrafft/.matplotlib
export MPLCONFIGDIR

On the target computer, append the following to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/runtime/glnxa64:/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/bin/glnxa64:/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/sys/os/glnxa64:/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads:/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/server:/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64



Next, set the XAPPLRESDIR environment variable to the following value:

/data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr/v717/X11/app-defaults

Help file from cluster:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL INFORMATION:
The cluster is flocked with the CSAIL cluster, which runs Condor.
Read the intro section of the Condor user manual and browse around the
Condor website (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor) to get a sense of what
the deal is.
Steps:
1. Login
2. Find this file (/data/cocosci/README).
3. add "matlab" and "condor" to your ~/.software file, each on a line
of their own.
4. Logout, login and continue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
RULES OF USE - 5/2007
- The cluster is an experimental service. Do not be cranky if your
job gets killed.
- Join the cluster-hackers mailinglist at CSAIL, and read the traffic.
- Don't submit jobs to non-cocosci machines unless you have learned the
basics of condor.
- Don't run jobs on cocosci nodes directly (that is, by sshing
in). Doing so makes baby jesus cry. And when baby jesus cries, Godzilla
gets angry.
- Do not run more than 4 jobs simultaneously if any of your running jobs
is long (ie will take more than 24 hours to complete).
- Make all your jobs save their work to /data/scratch, but copy results
to your CSAIL home directory or to /data/cocosci when you are done.
Otherwise you might lose your results and be very sad.

Compiling MATLAB Code on Picloud through CSAIL:
- compile code using MATLAB compiler (mcc command) on a linux architecture (e.g., on CSAIL's login.csail.mit.edu)
-- ssh to your login.csail.mit.edu 
-- add matlab to ~/.software
-- scp your matlab files to login.csail.mit.edu
-- open matlab, use mcc
--- add paths, e.g. > addpath ../matlab_code/
--- mcc file, e.g., > mcc -m run_crosscat.m
- create a new picloud environment (or use mine) for matlab
-- follow the picloud instructions for creating an environment
-- download the most recent MCR (sometimes you need to try multiple versions...)
--- e.g., from http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/
-- scp zipped MCR to picloud environment
-- install using silent mode
--- $ unzip MCRInstaller.zip
--- $ chmod 755 installer_input.txt
--- $ emacs installer_input.txt # change agree to license to yes, change destination file if necessary, e.g. /data/scratch/pkrafft/tabular-predDB/python_experiments/matlab/mcr
--- $ ./install -mode silent -inputFile installer_input.txt
- copy compiled code to picloud
-- open the environment in your browser (this takes a while!)
-- follow the direction after pressing "connect"
- make sure files have appropriate permissions
-- scripts should be 775
- use e.g.
>>> def test():
...     return os.popen('sh ./run_test.sh matlab/mcr/v717/ 1').read()
>>> cloud.call(test, _env='matlab')
